# great-hall-candle-controller

Remember those floating candles in the Great Hall in Harry Potter? Wouldn't it be fun to have a halloween decoration display that looked like that?

This project aims to recreate the floating candles of the great hall with motors controlling invisible suspension lines for fake candles!

The majority of the project is written in Python (for my own personal learning experience) while a simulation is provided through Processing.

See "Candle Construction & Mounting" for information on how to create your decorations!

Required hardware:
  -TP Tubes
  -Votive Candles
  -Motors
  -Fishing Line
  -Mounting Hardware
